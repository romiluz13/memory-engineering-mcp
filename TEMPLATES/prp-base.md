**Pattern**: Follow [specific pattern] from `[reference/file.tsx:line]`
**Approach**: [Brief description of approach]

```typescript
// EXACT pseudocode showing the approach
// Use real patterns from codebase research
interface [InterfaceName] {
  // Properties based on research
}

export const [ComponentName] = () => {
  // Implementation following discovered patterns
  // Include error handling strategy
  // Reference integration points
};
```

### Phase 2: [Second Major Step]
[Continue with same detail level...]

### Phase 3: [Integration & Testing]
**Integration Points**:
- Connects to: `[existing/component.tsx]`
- Modifies: `[files/that/change.tsx]`
- Dependencies: [npm packages or internal modules]

**Test Implementation**:
```typescript
// Test pattern following codebase conventions
describe('[FeatureName]', () => {
  // Tests based on research findings
});
```

## Validation Gates (Must be Executable)

npm run typecheck
```
**Expected**: Zero errors, zero warnings
**If fails**: [Specific troubleshooting based on research]

### Level 2: Unit Tests
```bash
npm test -- [feature-specific-test-pattern]
```
**Expected**: 100% pass rate, >80% coverage
**If fails**: [Common test failure patterns and fixes]

### Level 3: Integration Validation
```bash
npm run test:integration
# OR custom validation commands
```
**Expected**: [Specific integration success criteria]
**If fails**: [Integration troubleshooting steps]

### Level 4: Code Quality
```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
```
**Expected**: [Style and quality standards]
**If fails**: [Common linting issues and fixes]

## Context for Implementation AI

### Critical Context to Remember
- **Patterns**: Always use [specific pattern] from `[reference/file]`
- **Style**: Follow [specific style guide aspects]
- **Error Handling**: Use [project's error handling pattern]
- **State Management**: Follow [state management approach]

### Files to Study Before Implementation
1. `[path/to/similar/feature.tsx]` - [why it's relevant]
2. `[path/to/integration/point.tsx]` - [what to learn from it]
3. `[path/to/test/example.test.ts]` - [test pattern to follow]

### External Resources for Reference
- [Documentation URL] - [specific section to reference]
- [Example implementation URL] - [what to learn from it]
- [Best practices URL] - [key principles to apply]

## Quality Checklist

### Before Starting Implementation

## Confidence Assessment

**Current Confidence**: [1-10]/10

**Confidence Factors**:
- Pattern clarity: [1-10] - How clear are the patterns to follow?
- Context completeness: [1-10] - Is all necessary context included?
- Validation coverage: [1-10] - Are validation gates comprehensive?
- Gotcha preparation: [1-10] - Are potential issues identified?

**Ready for Implementation**: [YES/NO]
- Minimum confidence required: 8/10
- If <8, additional research needed in: [specific areas]

## Implementation Notes

### Expected File Changes
- Create: `[list of new files]`
- Modify: `[list of files to modify]`
- Test: `[list of test files to create/modify]`

### Estimated Complexity

## For Implementation Phase

When this PRP is complete and confidence >= 8/10, proceed with:

```bash
memory_engineering/execute-prp --prp "[feature-name]"
```

The implementation phase will:
1. Load this complete context
2. ULTRATHINK the implementation plan
3. Execute following patterns exactly
4. Run validation loops until all gates pass
5. Ensure original intent is fulfilled
