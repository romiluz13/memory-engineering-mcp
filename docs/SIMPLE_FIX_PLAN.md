# Simple Fix Plan - Making Memory Engineering Work Perfectly

## The Core Problem
Cursor uses our tools at 33% effectiveness because our tool descriptions don't match how AIs think about coding tasks.

## MCP Best Practices (From Research)
1. **Tool names**: Use descriptive, action-oriented names
2. **Descriptions**: Clear, concise, explain WHEN to use
3. **Examples**: Include in descriptions
4. **Simple flow**: Make it obvious what to do

## The Minimal Fix (Keep It Simple!)

### 1. Update Tool Descriptions ONLY

**memory_engineering/init**
```
Initialize AI memory system for your project. Run this once at project start.
Creates 6 memory files that help AI remember everything about your project.
```

**memory_engineering/read**
```
Read project memories to understand context. Use this to:
- AT SESSION START: Always read "activeContext.md" first
- BEFORE CODING: Read "systemPatterns.md" for conventions
- FOR DETAILS: Read any of the 6 core memory files
Example: read --fileName "activeContext.md"
```

**memory_engineering/update**
```
Save important information for future sessions. Use IMMEDIATELY when:
- Starting new work ‚Üí Update "activeContext.md" 
- Finding patterns ‚Üí Update "systemPatterns.md"
- Completing features ‚Üí Update "progress.md"
- Solving bugs ‚Üí Create working memory
Example: update --fileName "activeContext.md" --content "Working on: auth system..."
```

**memory_engineering/search**
```
Find how similar problems were solved before. ALWAYS use when:
- Starting ANY new feature ("find authentication patterns")
- Hitting errors ("find error handling")
- Wondering "how did we..." ("find state management")
Uses AI to understand your search and finds relevant memories.
```

**memory_engineering/sync**
```
Make memories searchable with AI embeddings. Run after adding new memories.
This helps search understand context better.
```

### 2. Add ONE Key Feature: Response Hints

After each tool response, add a contextual hint:

```javascript
// After search with good results
"üí° Found useful patterns? Update systemPatterns.md with improvements!"

// After reading activeContext.md  
"üìù Starting new work? Update this file as you progress!"

// After search with no results
"üÜï First time implementing this? Remember to save your solution!"
```

### 3. Test Protocol with Cursor

Give Cursor this exact task:
```
"Implement user authentication with JWT tokens. Use the memory system to check for existing patterns and update it as you work."
```

Track these 6 actions:
1. Reads memories at start? 
2. Searches before implementing?
3. Updates activeContext during work?
4. Saves working memories for bugs?
5. Updates systemPatterns with patterns?
6. Updates progress when done?

## What We're NOT Changing
- Tool names (avoid breaking changes)
- Core architecture 
- Database schema
- Memory classes

## Implementation Time: 2 Hours

1. Update tool descriptions (1 hour)
2. Add response hints (30 min)
3. Test with Cursor (30 min)

## Success Metrics
- Current: 33% (2/6 actions)
- Target: 83% (5/6 actions)
- Stretch: 100% (6/6 actions)

## The Key Insight
We don't need complex features. We need descriptions that match how AIs think:
- "Find patterns" not "Search with $rankFusion"
- "Save discoveries" not "Update memories"
- "Understand project" not "Read core files"

Keep the implementation perfect, make the interface natural.
