# Memory Bank Perfect - Back to Basics Plan

## 🎯 One Goal: Perfect Memory Bank with MCP

### The Original Vision (Keep It Simple)
```
"I MUST read ALL memory bank files at the start of EVERY task"
```

## ✅ What We Keep (The Good Stuff)

### 1. Core Memory Bank (6 Documents)
- **projectbrief** - What we're building
- **productContext** - Why it exists
- **activeContext** - Current work
- **systemPatterns** - How to build
- **techContext** - What we use
- **progress** - What's done
- **codebaseMap** - Where things are (bonus 7th)

### 2. MongoDB Storage
- Simple document storage (not files)
- Each memory is one document
- Clean names (no .md confusion)

### 3. Vector Search (Keep it Simple)
- Voyage AI embeddings (1024 dims)
- Vector search for semantic similarity
- Text search for keywords
- Hybrid search combining both
- **NO $rankFusion** - too complex!

### 4. Working Memory
- Debug sessions with 30-day TTL
- Actually useful for remembering solutions
- Simple event structure

## ❌ What We Drop (The Complexity)

### 1. Drop These Memory Classes
- ~~Insight memories~~ - Overcomplicated
- ~~Evolution memories~~ - Meta-nonsense
- ~~Pattern discovery~~ - Too automatic
- ~~Daily aggregations~~ - Solving fake problems

### 2. Drop These Features
- ~~$rankFusion~~ - Just use simple hybrid search
- ~~Insight deduplication~~ - Not needed without insights
- ~~Complex metadata~~ - Keep it minimal
- ~~Auto-everything~~ - Make it deliberate

### 3. Drop These Workflows
- ~~Automatic captures~~ - Manual is better
- ~~Meta-learning~~ - Too abstract
- ~~Self-improvement tracking~~ - Pointless

## 🛠️ Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Clean Up (TODAY)
1. Remove insight memory code
2. Remove evolution memory code
3. Simplify search to basic hybrid (vector + text)
4. Remove all auto-capture logic

### Phase 2: Perfect the Basics
1. Enforce `start_session` - MANDATORY
2. Add Plan Mode workflow
3. Add Act Mode workflow
4. Simple `memory_bank_update` command

### Phase 3: Test & Polish
1. Test complete flow
2. Update all documentation
3. Clean examples
4. Prepare for npm

## 📋 The Perfect Memory Bank MCP

### Tools (Only 6!)
```typescript
1. memory_engineering_init          // One-time setup
2. memory_engineering_start_session  // MANDATORY at start
3. memory_engineering_read           // Read specific memory
4. memory_engineering_update         // Update one memory
5. memory_engineering_memory_bank_update // Update multiple
6. memory_engineering_search         // Search when needed
```

### Workflow
```
1. Start session (MANDATORY)
   - Reads ALL core memories
   - Shows current context
   
2. Work Mode
   - Plan Mode: Read → Plan → Present
   - Act Mode: Read → Execute → Document
   
3. Updates
   - Deliberate, thoughtful
   - "update memory bank" command
   - Manual, not automatic
   
4. Search (Secondary)
   - Only after reading core
   - Simple hybrid search
   - No complex scoring
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

1. **Simple** - 6 tools, clear purpose
2. **Mandatory** - Must read all at start
3. **Deliberate** - Manual updates
4. **Fast** - No complex algorithms
5. **Clear** - Anyone can understand

## 📝 What Makes This Perfect

### Back to Bicycle, Not Ferrari
- Original: 6 files, must read all
- Us: Same, but with MongoDB + vectors
- Result: Best of both worlds

### What We Learned
- Complexity kills adoption
- Mandatory discipline matters
- Manual updates > automatic
- Search is secondary, not primary

### The Key Insight
> "We don't need to track insights about insights. We need to remember what we're building."

## ✨ End Result

A Memory Bank that:
1. Forces AI to read context (mandatory)
2. Stores memories reliably (MongoDB)
3. Searches effectively (vectors)
4. Updates deliberately (manual)
5. Stays simple (6 tools)

**This is the Memory Bank the original vision deserved.**
