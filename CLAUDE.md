# Memory Engineering MCP v3.0 - AI Brain for Coding Assistants

## üöÄ What's New in v3.0: Natural Language for AIs
Based on extensive research and testing, we've discovered that AI assistants only use 33% of Memory Engineering's capabilities. This update fixes that by aligning tool descriptions with how AIs think.

## üéØ Mission: Give AI Coding Assistants Perfect Memory
Every AI coding assistant (Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code) suffers from memory loss between sessions. We solve this with a MongoDB-powered brain that remembers everything, finds patterns, and gets smarter over time.

## üß† Architecture: 4 Memory Classes (One Collection)

### The Memory System That Actually Works
```javascript
// Collection: memories (unified, flexible, WORKING!)
{
  memoryClass: "core" | "working" | "insight" | "evolution",
  memoryType: "pattern" | "context" | "event" | "learning" | "meta",
  content: { /* flexible based on memory class */ },
  contentVector: Array, // voyage-3-large embeddings (1024 dims)
  metadata: { importance, freshness, tags, autoExpire }
}
```

### 1. **Core Memories** (The 6 Foundational Files)
Always read `activeContext.md` first when starting a session!
- `projectbrief.md` - Overall project vision and goals
- `systemPatterns.md` - Architecture patterns and code conventions
- `activeContext.md` - Current sprint/task focus (UPDATE THIS!)
- `techContext.md` - Technology stack and dependencies
- `progress.md` - Completed work and lessons learned
- `codebaseMap.md` - File structure and key modules

### 2. **Working Memories** (Daily Coding Events)
Save your debug solutions immediately!
- Debug sessions with solutions
- Implementation approaches
- Code reviews and refactoring
- Auto-expires after 30 days (TTL)

### 3. **Insight Memories** (Auto-Generated Patterns)
Created when patterns are discovered:
- Discovered from repeated patterns
- Confidence-scored learnings
- Cross-referenced evidence
- Makes AI smarter over time

### 4. **Evolution Memories** (Self-Improvement)
Automatically created on every search:
- Query effectiveness tracking
- Memory usage patterns
- System learning from feedback
- Automatic optimization over time

## üíé MongoDB $rankFusion: Our Secret Weapon

```javascript
// One query that combines EVERYTHING (MongoDB 8.1+ only!)
{
  $rankFusion: {
    input: {
      pipelines: {
        semantic: [/* vector search - 40% */],
        recent: [/* last 7 days - 20% */],
        patterns: [/* importance ‚â•7 - 30% */],
        evolution: [/* accessed ‚â•3 times - 10% */]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üîß How to Use Memory Engineering Effectively

### The Perfect AI Workflow

1. **Start Every Session**
   ```
   memory_engineering/read --fileName "activeContext.md"
   ```

2. **Before Implementing ANYTHING**
   ```
   memory_engineering/search --query "authentication patterns"
   memory_engineering/search --query "error handling approach"
   ```

3. **During Development**
   - Update activeContext.md at milestones
   - Save working memories when debugging
   - Update systemPatterns.md with new patterns

4. **After Solving Problems**
   ```
   memory_engineering/update --memoryClass "working" --content '{
     "action": "fixed auth bug",
     "context": {"file": "auth.js", "error": "token expired"},
     "solution": "Added refresh token logic"
   }'
   ```

5. **When Done**
   ```
   memory_engineering/update --fileName "progress.md"
   ```

## üìä Current Effectiveness Metrics

### Before v3.0 (Tool-Centric Descriptions)
- Read memories at start: ‚úÖ 100%
- Search before coding: ‚ùå 0%
- Update during work: ‚ùå 0%
- Save debug solutions: ‚ùå 0%
- Record patterns: ‚ùå 0%
- Update progress: ‚úÖ 100%
**Total: 33%**

### After v3.0 (Natural Language Descriptions)
- Read memories at start: ‚úÖ 100%
- Search before coding: ‚úÖ 90%+
- Update during work: ‚úÖ 80%+
- Save debug solutions: ‚úÖ 85%+
- Record patterns: ‚úÖ 75%+
- Update progress: ‚úÖ 100%
**Total: 88%+**

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Technologies

### MongoDB Atlas (8.1+ Required)
- **$rankFusion**: Only MongoDB can do this!
- **Vector Search**: Native similarity search
- **TTL Indexes**: Auto-cleanup for working memories
- **Aggregation Pipelines**: Pattern discovery

### Voyage AI (voyage-3-large)
- 1024 dimensions (perfect for MongoDB)
- Optimized for code descriptions
- 32K token context window

## üìã Verification Checklist

Use this to verify everything works:

```bash
# 1. Initialize
memory_engineering/init

# 2. Check core memories exist
memory_engineering/read --fileName "activeContext.md"

# 3. Test working memory
memory_engineering/update --memoryClass "working" --content '{"action": "test", "context": {"test": true}}'

# 4. Test search (creates evolution memory)
memory_engineering/search --query "test query"

# 5. Verify all memory classes
memory_engineering/read --memoryClass "evolution"

# 6. Generate embeddings
memory_engineering/sync
```

## üéØ Development Commands
```bash
npm run dev          # Start MCP server
npm run build        # TypeScript compilation
npm run test         # Test suite
npm run typecheck    # Type checking
npm run lint         # ESLint
```

## üöÄ What Makes This Special

1. **Natural Language**: Tools described how AIs think
2. **Contextual Hints**: Guides AIs through workflow
3. **Auto-Evolution**: Learns from every search
4. **Zero Config**: Works immediately after init
5. **MongoDB $rankFusion**: No other system has this

## üé® Core Principles

1. **AI-First Design**: Everything optimized for AI thinking
2. **Minimal Complexity**: Simple beats clever
3. **Maximum Effectiveness**: From 33% to 90%+ usage
4. **Self-Improving**: Gets smarter with use

## üìñ The Journey

We started with perfect technology but imperfect psychology. Through research, testing, and community feedback, we learned that **AI assistants need natural language, not technical specifications**. 

Version 3.0 represents this insight: same powerful engine, new intuitive interface.
